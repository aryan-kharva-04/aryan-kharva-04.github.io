        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        <h3 style="text-align: left"><a href="https://www.apple.com/store?afid=p238%7CseIEs444j-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_688576362465_pgrid_13945964887_pntwk_g_pchan__pexid__&cid=aos-us-kwgo-brand-apple--slid---product-">Apple Inc.</a></h3>
            <p style="text-align: left">Apple is a global technology company selling numerous innovative electronics, software, and services with a minimalist website design famously characterized by its white background and sleek visuals. </p>
                <ul style="text-align: left">
                    <li><b>Contrast: </b>To improve user visibility, Apple's website features elements with distinct contrasts. For instance, Apple advertises its newest goods on the homepage. Either black text appears in a white box, or white text appears in a black box. The website displays this theme consistently throughout its pages.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Repetition: </b>Speaking of displaying themes consistently, repetition is a prominent principle used throughout Apple’s website. Alongside colors, the website does a great job of using the same font, specifically the San Francisco font, which was designed by the company.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Alignment: </b>Part of what makes Apple’s website so visually appealing is how the elements of the page are aligned in a way that helps the website flow. For example, on the homepage, the product images along with their captions are all lined up and organized in a grid system, so there’s consistency with each product listed.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Proximity: </b>Apple groups related elements together, so users can understand the relationships between the different elements on the page. For example, the Mac products are grouped, and the iPhones are grouped. This will help users, especially ones who aren’t familiar with Apple’s product lineup, to be able to get information on the devices they want much more swiftly and efficiently. </li>
                </ul>
            <p style="text-align: left"><b>Assessment: </b>Apple’s website does an excellent job of displaying the CRAP principles on its website for users by making sure each page isn’t cluttered and unorganized. Users can decipher the purpose of each element on the website through the combination of all of these principles, and efficiently navigate through its many pages.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: left"><a href="https://www.lingscars.com/">LINGsCARS</a></h3>
            <p style="text-align: left">LINGsCARS is a UK-based car sales and leasing company founded by Ling Valentine. Her company gained attention for its website’s unique and slightly unconventional design. </p>
                <ul style="text-align: left">
                    <li><b>Contrast: </b>Many of the font color choices on LINGsCARS’ website are made to be only slightly different from its background. For example, on its homepage, there’s a car listed with a description in black text on a dark gray background. While I’m able to make out what it says, it can be difficult for some.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Repetition: </b>There is very little repetition on LINGsCARS’ website. Each listed car has a different colored background with different colored text making each one unique. Inconsistent fonts and font sizes are used throughout the website giving it no professionalism whatsoever.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Alignment: </b>The alignment on the website is surprisingly fine for the most part, but there are some inconsistencies and mistakes throughout the pages. For example, some of the dividers are longer than others on the homepage.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Proximity: </b>Different elements on LINGsCARS’ website are grouped, so users can tell them apart, but they are done so through images of line dividers and not empty space. Elements are still clumped together and unorganized. </li>
                </ul>
            <p style="text-align: left"><b>Assessment: </b>LINGsCars is a uniquely designed website that showcases Ling’s entertaining persona perfectly, yet from a professional perspective, the website isn’t very well-designed at all in accordance with the CRAP principles. From inconsistencies with color contrast to misalignment, the website lacks in numerous areas that one would expect from a car dealership’s website.</p><br>
