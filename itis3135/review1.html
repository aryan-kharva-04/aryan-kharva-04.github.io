        <h3>CheckList</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Does the submission lead right to the page to be reviewed?: </b>Yes. The link leads users right to the home page (index.html).</li>
            <li><b>Are there any spaces or upper-cases in the file/folder names, including scripts, images, etc.?: </b> No. All website file/folder names and all other components utilize a proper naming format.</li>
            <li><b>Design: </b></li>
            <ol type="a">
                <li><b>Does the page have sufficient contrast/font sizing?: </b>Yes. Every page of the webpage utilizes a font that's easy to read in contrast with the white background. The size of the font is also large enough so most users will be able to see the information clearly.</li>
                <li><b>Does the page have site colors and fonts using a .css file?: </b>Yes. The site implements the site colors and fonts using a .css file that's been linked in the head of each page. </li>
                <li><b>Does the page implement the CRAP Principles: ?</b></li>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li><b>Contrast: </b>There's an excellent contrast of colors between the font and the backgrounds it's placed in front of. The different shades of blue with the white works well for users and looks aesthetically pleasing.</li>
                    <li><b>Repetition: </b>Repetition is displayed perfectly throughout the website. Fonts are consistent, and the same color scheme is used throughout each page of the site.</li>
                    <li><b>Alignment: </b>The website does a great job of having consistent alignment throughout its five pages. Even so, the website could truly benefit from having larger left and right margins for its text. The information on each page spans too far from edge to edge which can result in an uneasy reading experience for users.</li>
                    <li><b>Proximity: </b>Proximity isn't a problem for this website. Components that are associated with each other are placed in its own block on each page. This method makes the information organized and easy to read, in addition to being aesthetically pleasing. </li>
                </ol>
            </ol>
            <li>Does the page have the following within it?:</li>
            <ol type="a">
                <li><b>Header: </b>Yes.</li>
                <li><b>Main: </b>Yes.</li>
                <li><b>Footer: </b>Yes.</li>
            </ol>
            <li><b>Does the header have a site/brand header with text in an h1 tag?: </b>The site header is there for the index page, but then is changed to the page name for the other pages. The site name; "Clearing the Air: Understanding Lung Cancer", should be consistent through navigation of all pages of the site. The h2 tag should state the page names instead. </li>
            <li><b>Does the main start with the page name as an h2, and not include the name of the site/brand?: </b>Yes. The site utilizes h2 tags to write the page names at the start of the main. One area of critique could be that the page names in the nav bar and the h2 tag aren't consistent for every page of the site. For example, the "Screening Guidelines" page in the nav bar is written as "Lung Cancer Screening Guidelines" in the header. It would be best to keep consistent naming schemes for a more professional look and feel.</li>
            <li><b>Brand tagline?: </b>There is no tagline for this project as it's not for a brand or company. </li>
            <li><b>Does the footer have the following components?: </b></li>
            <ol type="a">
                <li><b>Menu for user's pages: </b>Yes.</li>
                <li><b>HTML Validation: </b>Yes.</li>
                <li><b>CSS Validation: </b>Yes.</li>
            </ol>
            <li><b>Does the site have any specific requirements for the assignment?: </b>Yes. All needed components are there on the site.</li>
        </ol>
