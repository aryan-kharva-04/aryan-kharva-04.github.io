        <h3>CheckList</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Does the submission lead right to the page to be reviewed?: </b>Yes. The link leads users right to the home page (index.html).</li>
            <li><b>Are there any spaces or upper-cases in the file/folder names, including scripts, images, etc.?: </b> No. All website file/folder names and all other components utilize a proper naming format.</li>
            <li><b>Design: </b></li>
            <ol type="a">
                <li><b>Does the page have sufficient contrast/font sizing?: </b>Yes. Every page of the webpage utilizes a white font that's easy to read in contrast with the dark blue background. The size of the font is also large enough so most users will be able to see the information clearly.</li>
                <li><b>Does the page have site colors and fonts using a .css file?: </b>Yes. The site implements the site colors and fonts using a .css file that's been linked in the head of each page. </li>
                <li><b>Does the page implement the CRAP Principles: ?</b></li>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li><b>Contrast: </b>Although there is a clear contrast between the background colors and the text, the website could truly benefit from a color scheme that both works well for the website's aesthetics, but also have a clear contrast for legibility purposes.</li>
                    <li><b>Repetition: </b>The website does an excellent job of repeating the color scheme and font styles throughout the pages of the site. The website's aesthetic could be largely improved by keeping the headers and images of each page consistent in size and style.</li>
                    <li><b>Alignment: </b>As the development of the site progresses, I'm assured that the alignment of the website will be improved as more content is implemented on each of the pages. As of right now, the alignment could be largely improved with better consistency between the pages. Moreover, the website could truly benefit from having larger left and right margins for its text. The information on each page spans too far from edge to edge which can result in an uneasy reading experience for users.</li>
                    <li><b>Proximity: </b>Proximity isn't a problem for this website. Components that are associated with each other are placed close to one another. This method makes the information organized and easy to read, in addition to being aesthetically pleasing. </li>
                </ol>
            </ol>
            <li>Does the page have the following within it?:</li>
            <ol type="a">
                <li><b>Header: </b>Yes.</li>
                <li><b>Main: </b>Yes.</li>
                <li><b>Footer: </b>Yes.</li>
            </ol>
            <li><b>Does the header have a site/brand header with text in an h1 tag?: </b>At the current moment the site does not have a site/brand header with text in an h1 tag. Instead, the page headers are placed in h1 tags instead of h2 tags.</li>
            <li><b>Does the main start with the page name as an h2, and not include the name of the site/brand?: </b>Currently the main starts with a figure rather than the page header in a h2 tag. The page header is actually placed in an h1 tag instead. The website's aesthetic and consistency could be greatly approved with the header title as the first part of the page instead of a figure.</li>
            <li><b>Brand tagline?: </b>There is no tagline for this project currently. </li>
            <li><b>Does the footer have the following components?: </b></li>
            <ol type="a">
                <li><b>Menu for user's pages: </b>Yes.</li>
                <li><b>HTML Validation: </b>No.</li>
                <li><b>CSS Validation: </b>No.</li>
            </ol>
            <li><b>Does the site have any specific requirements for the assignment?: </b>Yes. All foundational components are there on the site.</li>
        </ol>
